Gotag Song Metadata Editor (WIP)

Note: This is a work in progress and a beginner project. I'm still learning, so the code is likely messy, and the project isn't fully functional yet. Please don't try to use it until it's ready!

What is this?

This is a simple command-line tool for editing song metadata (like ID3 tags for MP3s). It is my first attempt at building something in Go, so things might not work as expected!

Current Status
    Not usable yet: The tool is still under development.
    Features in progress:
        Editing song metadata (artist, album, year, genre, etc.)
        Saving changes to the audio file
    No UI: This is a CLI tool, meaning it's used via the command line.

What Iâ€™m Learning
    How to work with Go (this is my first Go project!)
    Working with file systems and manipulating files
    Understanding audio file metadata formats like ID3 tags

How to Run It (Not Ready Yet)

Warning: This tool is not functional yet, but if you're curious, you can clone the repo and check out the code.

git clone https://github.com/just6n/gotag.git
cd gotag
# Currently, no instructions to run the tool since it's not working yet!

To Do

- Implement functionality to read and edit metadata.
- Write tests to ensure it works.
- Add error handling and improve code quality.
- Make it more user-friendly and create a proper CLI interface.

Contributing

Feel free to fork the project, open issues, or suggest improvements! Since this is a beginner project, I'm open to feedback and learning from others.
